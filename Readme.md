My personal introduction to front end development
The goal of the project is to create two websites: "Its so over" and "We're so back"

The websites will point to eachother, putting users in a loop.

**This project exists soley because the domains cost less than a large pizza at papa johns**

Also, should anyone want to use either of the two domains, create an issue and we can talk :kissing_smiling_eyes:
